# Neo4j-backed Agentic System

Below describes a v0.1 of idea of an agentic system backed by Neo4j. 

## Advantages of Graph-Based Agent Systems


## 1. Flexible Agent Relationships
- **Dynamic topology**: Agent relationships can evolve and reconfigure at runtime
- **Complex workflows**: Easily represent multi-step, conditional agent interactions
- **Specialization**: Agents can focus on specific tasks while maintaining connections to other capabilities

## 2. Rich Context and Memory
- **Contextual awareness**: Access to structured, interconnected knowledge
- **Relationship-based reasoning**: Understand how information relates, not just the information itself
- **Memory management**: Automatic summarization and organization of stored information
- **Historical context**: Maintain and reference execution history for learning

## 3. Improved Reasoning Capabilities
- **Graph-based inference**: Leverage graph algorithms for reasoning
- **Path finding**: Discover connections between concepts that might not be obvious
- **Relationship traversal**: Follow chains of reasoning through explicit relationships

## 4. System Introspection
- **Self-modification**: The system can analyze and modify its own structure
- **Runtime debugging**: Observe exactly how information flows between components
- **Execution tracing**: Complete visibility into the decision-making process

## 5. Operational Benefits
- **Persistence**: State is automatically preserved between sessions
- **Scalability**: Graph databases scale well for complex relationship networks
- **Monitoring**: Built-in ability to analyze performance and behavior patterns
- **Resilience**: Distributed nature helps prevent single points of failure

## 6. Development Advantages
- **Modular design**: Easy to add new agent types, tools, or memory structures
- **Visual representation**: Graph databases provide intuitive visualization of the system
- **Query capabilities**: Powerful querying for complex system analysis
- **Extensibility**: Foundation for more sophisticated multi-agent architectures


## Node Types

1. **Agent**
   - Represents an AI agent with specific capabilities
   - Properties: id, name, type, status, LLM configuration, etc.
   - Types can include: reasoning, router, assistant, etc.

2. **Tool**
   - External capabilities that agents can use
   - Properties: id, name, type, description, configuration
   - Examples: search tools, calculators, code execution, etc.

3. **Log**
   - Records of agent and tool operations
   - Properties: id, timestamp, level, message, execution details
   - Captures inputs, outputs, durations, errors

4. **Memory**
   - Persistent information storage
   - Properties: id, key, value, memory_type, priority, expiration
   - Types: long-term, short-term, context, etc.

## Key Relationships

1. **Agent → Tool**: `CAN_USE`
   - Defines which tools an agent has access to
   - Properties: priority, permissions

2. **Agent → Agent**: `DELEGATES_TO`
   - Allows agents to pass tasks to other specialized agents
   - Properties: condition, priority

3. **Agent → Log**: `GENERATED`
   - Records actions taken by agents

4. **Agent → Memory**: `STORES`
   - Agent writes information to memory

5. **Memory → Agent**: `INFORMS`
   - Memory provides context to agent operations
   - Properties: relevance_score

6. **Tool → Log**: `PRODUCED`
   - Tools generate logs of their operations

7. **Log → Memory**: `CONTRIBUTES_TO`
   - Logs can be processed to update memory
   - Properties: weight

8. **Agent → Agent**: `COMMUNICATES_WITH`
   - Direct communication between agents
   - Properties: protocol

9. **Memory → Memory**: `REFERENCES`
   - Links between related memory nodes
   - Properties: strength

10. **Agent → Agent**: `TRANSITIONS_TO`
    - Execution flow between agents
    - Properties: condition
